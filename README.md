# Network Flow Parallelization
This is a research project for COP_4520: Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Processing.

We are exploring how to parallelize common network flow algorithms and empirically test the benefits of making it parallel.

The following are the algorithms and the group members working on making it parallel:
### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
#### John Pham and Neo Camanga

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
#### Glenn Hartwell

### Dinics Algorithm
#### Brian Moon and Federico Baron

## READMEs
Please look into each README.md within each directory.
The READMEs for `Ford_Fulkerson`, `Edmonds_Karp`, and `Dinics` describe the respective
algorithms.
The README in `dataset` directory describes the experiments and results for each algorithm.
