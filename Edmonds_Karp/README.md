Dinic's algorithm is a flow algorithm that was created by Dr. Yefim Dinitz, and is notable for being strongly polynomial with an O(V^2E) run-time. Dinic's algorithm innovates on other flow algorithms with its use of level graphs and blocking flows. Dinic's algorithm uses BFS and DFS in order to achieve this superior run-time; bread-first search for building a level graph, and depth-first search with blocking flows in order to find the maximum flow efficiently.
