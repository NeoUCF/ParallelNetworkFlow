In 1972 Edmonds and Karp published a paper detailing a specific protocol using the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing max flow and min cut. The Edmonds-Karp (EK) algorithm is one of the earliest solutions for solving the maximum flow in a network of nodes that can be represented as a graph. Unlike its predecessor, it has a well defined specification on how to perform searches for augmenting paths. While Ford-Fulkerson may use any search method, often DFS, EK requires the use of BFS to find augmenting paths which improves theoretical runtimes from O(E|f|), where f is the max flow of the graph, to O(V^2E).
