\subsection{Challenges}
    Some of the biggest challenges we have faced in this research process was understanding the relevant literature with regards to each of our algorithms. Network flow is not a particularly well-explored topic in parallel programming, remaining a more niche field of study. As a result, the majority of research that we were able to find lacked solid implementation examples or were out of scope for what the project team was able to do at this point in time.

\subsection{Completed Tasks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ford Fulkerson
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Sequential and Parallelizable Version of FF
                \item Algorithm Sketch of Parallel FF
                \item Potential Optimizations of Parallel FF researched
                \item Successful Testing of Sequential FF with Test-Cases
            \end{itemize}
        \item Edmund Karp
            \begin{itemize}
