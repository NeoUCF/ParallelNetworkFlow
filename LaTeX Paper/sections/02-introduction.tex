\section{Introduction}

In graph theory, the field of Network Flow determines the max-
imum flow possible from the source node to the sink node. In a
network/transportation flow graph, each edge represents a flow
and capacity. Network flowâ€™s various real-world applications
include infrastructure management such as roads, pipes, or elec-
trical systems, or things more abstract such as team pairing, or
ecology systems such as food webs. There are many algorithms
which serve to find the maximum flow of a graph. In this pa-
per, we explore three algorithms and we parallelize them to in-
crease efficiency to find the max flow. The algorithms are Ford-
Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, and Dinics.
