\section{Introduction}

In graph theory, the field of Network Flow determines the maximum flow possible from the source node to the sink node. Network flowâ€™s various real-world applications include infrastructure management such as roads, pipes, or electrical systems, or things more abstract such as team pairing, or ecology systems such as food webs. There are many algorithms which serve to find the maximum flow of a graph. In this paper, we explore three algorithms and we parallelize them to increase efficiency to find the max flow. The algorithms are Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, and Dinics.
