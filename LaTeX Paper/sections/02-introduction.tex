\section{Introduction}

Research pertaining to the max flow solution of network flow problems traces back to Ford and Fulkerson's paper published in 1962. Since then several other algorithms have been published that are capable of computing these max flows with increasingly better run times. In 1972, Edmonds and Karp proposed a modification to the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm which helped stabilize the run time and guarantee completion. Around the same time, Dinitz, proposed his own solution to max flow problem. Each of these algorithms uses the augmenting paths approach to finding max flow, and these types of algorithms have not been heavily parallelized in the past. Our research attempts to discover parallelization options for these algorithms and compares them to their sequential counterparts as well as each other.
