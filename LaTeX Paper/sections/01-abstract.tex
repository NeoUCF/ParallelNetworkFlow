    In graph theory, the field of Network Flow determines the maximum flow possible from the source node to the sink node. In a
    network/transportation flow graph, each edge represents a flow
    and capacity. Network flowâ€™s various real-world applications
    include infrastructure management including roads, pipes, electrical systems, even fields more abstract such as team pairing or
    ecology systems such as food webs. There are many algorithms
    which serve to find the maximum flow of a graph. In this paper,
    we explore three algorithms and we parallelize them to increase
    efficiency to find the max flow. The algorithms are Ford-
    Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, and Dinics.
